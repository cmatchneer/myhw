    <p><strong>Hi my name is Christopher call me Chris if you like I am not very picky on that
        I am 27 years old born on November 30th and as result of that I have a tolerance for the cold.
        I played tennis in college and still play when I can but courts get pricey when it gets cold. 
        I enjoy most kinds of food except for cooked fish cant stand it. I will eat all the sugar and 
        have to just not buy it to save myself from myself. I work at Trader Joes and I am taking this course
        to help me change my career.<br></strong>
